# Libations
- With a simple UI, this application is for picking out a brewery, brewpub, or beerbar to get your drink on. After the user types in a city, they are given a list of local places with a link to their website, as well as the local weather. By utilizing local storage, the user can return to the app and see the last places they searched.
